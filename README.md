# Traeky

> Self-hosted crypto portfolio & tax overview.

Traeky is a privacy-friendly, self-hostable web app to track your crypto portfolio and generate a basic tax overview.
The UI runs entirely in your browser, data is stored locally, and encrypted backups can be created for safekeeping.

> Cloud sync / "Traeky Cloud" integration is optional. In the standalone build described here, no portfolio data is sent to any third-party service unless you explicitly configure it.

## Features

- Track crypto holdings and transactions
- Portfolio and gain/loss overview
- Export a tax PDF
- CSV import & export (Traeky-specific schema)
- End-to-end encrypted backups
- Local-first: everything runs in the browser, no external API required for basic usage
- English and German translations

---

## Project status

Traeky is currently in an early version (`0.0.1`).
APIs, data schema and UI are subject to change between releases.

---

## Docker images

Docker images are published to Docker Hub:

- `pandabytelabs/traeky:latest` – latest stable release from `main`
- `pandabytelabs/traeky:stable` – alias for the latest stable release
- `pandabytelabs/traeky:testing` – pre-release builds from `develop`
- `pandabytelabs/traeky:<version>` – versioned images (e.g. `0.0.1`)

Tags:

- **Stable (main)** → `latest`, `stable`, and `:<version>`
- **Pre-release (develop)** → `testing` and `:<version>`

---

## Quick start with Docker (recommended)

### Run the stable image

```bash
docker run --rm   -p 5173:5173   --name traeky   pandabytelabs/traeky:latest
```

Now open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

### Run the testing (pre-release) image

```bash
docker run --rm   -p 5173:5173   --name traeky-testing   pandabytelabs/traeky:testing
```

### Environment variables

The app supports configuration via environment variables. One example is:

- `DISABLE_CLOUD_CONNECT`
  - `true` → disables cloud connect features in the standalone build
  - `false` or unset → cloud connect may be enabled (depending on your backend configuration)

Example with cloud connect disabled:

```bash
docker run --rm   -p 5173:5173   -e DISABLE_CLOUD_CONNECT=true   --name traeky   pandabytelabs/traeky:latest
```

## Self-hosting without Docker

You can also build and host Traeky yourself, e.g. on your own server or behind a reverse proxy.

### 1. Install dependencies

You need:

- Node.js 20+
- npm (comes with Node)

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Development server (for local usage)

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

This mode is intended for development and local testing.

### 3. Production build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate static assets in the `dist/` directory.

You can serve `dist/` with any static file server, for example:

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve dist
```

Or configure a reverse proxy like Nginx / Caddy to serve the `dist` directory over HTTPS.

---

## Running your own Docker image (self-built)

If you prefer to build your own image instead of using the public Docker Hub images:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t traeky:local .

# Run it
docker run --rm   -p 5173:5173   --name traeky-local   traeky:local
```

You can then tag & push it to your own registry if you like.

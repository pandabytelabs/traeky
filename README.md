# Traeky

[![Release][release-shield]][release-url]

> Local (and self-hosted) crypto portfolio.

Traeky is a privacy-friendly, self-hostable web app to track your crypto portfolio and generate a basic report.
The UI runs entirely in your browser, data is stored locally.

---

## Features

- Track crypto holdings and transactions
- Portfolio and gain/loss overview
- Export a PDF report
- CSV import & export (Traeky-specific schema)
- Local-first: everything runs in the browser, no external API required (except coingecko price fetching) for basic usage
- English and German translations

---

## Project status

Traeky is currently in an early version (see version badge above).
APIs, data schema and UI are subject to change between releases.

---

## Docker images

Docker images are published to Docker Hub:

- `pandabytelabs/traeky:latest` – latest stable release from `main`
- `pandabytelabs/traeky:stable` – alias for the latest stable release
- `pandabytelabs/traeky:testing` – pre-release builds from `develop`
- `pandabytelabs/traeky:nightly` – nightly builds from `develop`
- `pandabytelabs/traeky:<version>` – versioned images (matching the app version shown above)

Tags:

- **Stable (main)** → `latest`, `stable`, and `:<version>`
- **Pre-release (develop)** → `testing` and `:<version>`
- **Nightly (develop)** → `nightly`

---

## Quick start with Docker (recommended)

### Run the stable image

```bash
docker run --rm -p 5173:5173 --name traeky pandabytelabs/traeky:latest
```

Now open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

### Run the testing (pre-release) image

```bash
docker run --rm -p 5173:5173 --name traeky-testing pandabytelabs/traeky:testing
```

### Environment variables

The app supports configuration via environment variables.

- `TRAEKY_PROFILE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
  - Generate one with 'openssl rand -base64 32'
  - **If the key is changed**, all local profiles can no longer be decrypted.

- `TRAEKY_PROFILE_PIN_SALT`
  - Must be **exactly 64 characters** long and only contain `A-Z`, `a-z`, or `0-9`
  - If the value is invalid, Traeky falls back to a built-in default salt and logs an error in the browser console
  - For best security, set this to a random 64-character value and keep it stable once profiles exist

- `TRAEKY_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
  - Controls which `Host` headers the dev server will accept
  - Examples:
    - `TRAEKY_ALLOWED_HOSTS=example.com`
    - `TRAEKY_ALLOWED_HOSTS=example.net,example.com`
    - `TRAEKY_ALLOWED_HOSTS=all` (or `true` / `*`) to allow all hosts

Example with online features disabled and a custom profile PIN salt:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 5173:5173 \
  -e TRAEKY_ALLOWED_HOSTS=myTraekyDomain.tld \
  -e TRAEKY_PROFILE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=here-your-long-random-key \
  -e TRAEKY_PROFILE_PIN_SALT=CHANGEMETOARANDOMSIXTYFOURCHARALPHANUMERICVALUE00000000000000000 \
  --name traeky \
  pandabytelabs/traeky:latest
```

## Self-hosting without Docker

You can also build and host Traeky yourself, e.g. on your own server or behind a reverse proxy.

### 1. Install dependencies

You need:

- Node.js 20+
- npm (comes with Node)

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Development server (for local usage)

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

This mode is intended for development and local testing.

### 3. Production build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate static assets in the `dist/` directory.

You can serve `dist/` with any static file server, for example:

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve dist
```

Or configure a reverse proxy like Nginx / Caddy to serve the `dist` directory over HTTPS.

---

## Running your own Docker image (self-built)

If you prefer to build your own image instead of using the public Docker Hub images:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t traeky:local .

# Run it
docker run --rm -p 5173:5173 --name traeky-local traeky:local
```

You can then tag & push it to your own registry if you like.
